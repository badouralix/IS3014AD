## Thoughts

Two phases :

1. Build the AST according to the grammar / syntax
1. Run an execution according to the semantic. This requires a state / an environment of all the variables. Also, **executing** a command is fairly different from **evaluating** an expression

Running an analysis and building up tests will probably be much easier in within an SSA form.
